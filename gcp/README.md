Launch Darkly Event Puller
This Launch Darkly integration takes webhooks from Launch Darkly and translates them into readable custom events in Komodor. You can utilize this python script in Cloud Run along with the Cloud Run URL. These events can then be seen in the events tab of the Komodor platform. Please input your Komodor API key in the requested line item or utilize vault or other variable to input your key. You will also need to input the URL endpoint on the Launch Darkly side.
